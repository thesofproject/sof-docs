Logger
######

The sof-logger is used to print logs delivered from the FW `dma_trace`
mechanism by searching log entries in the `ldc` file (logs dictionary)
that are generated by the *SMEX* (Sof Metadata Extractor) tool. Every entry
declared in the FW is placed in an elf output file (e.g. sof-apl) in the
`.static_log_entries` section in a struct form that is defined in `sof/src/include/sof/trace.h` in the `sof` fw repo.

The `ldc` file contains `snd_sof_logs_header` and `snd_sof_uids_header`
(defined in smex/ldc.h). `snd_sof_logs_header` is followed by a
`.static_log_entries` section incorporated from the FW elf file (e.g.
sof-apl). `snd_sof_logs_header` contains basic information about the
`.static_log_entries` section such as `base_address` and `data_length`. The
sof-logger works by reading entry parameters values and entries addresses from the FW `dma_trace` mechanism and searching for suitable entries in the
`ldc` file by its address. The `snd_sof_uids_header` struct is followed by
the `.static_uuid_entries` section content from the FW elf file. A single
uuid entry is defined in `sof/src/include/sof/lib/uuid.h` in the `sof` fw
repo.

Examples
--------

- Gets traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file; disable compatibility
  check between given ldc_file with fw_version saved in default location
  and prints logs to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -n

- Gets traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file; verifies the
  fw_version with the ver_file file and prints logs to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -v ver_file

- Get traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to
  stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file

  the out_file file

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -o out_file

- Get traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to
  stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -t

- Get traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to
  the out_file file

  .. code-block:: bash

- c flag defines the clock value (in MHz) used to format log timestamps. By
  default, the clock value is set to 19.2 (MHz). The below example sets the
  clock value to 19.9 (MHz).

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file -c 19.9

- Dump information from the ldc file (such as the ABI version and the uuid
  dictionary) to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -d


.. note::
  debugfs files used by ``sof-logger``

  - ``etrace``: direct access to the shared TRACE window of the SOF firmware
  - ``trace``: using DMA to stream debug trace information from SOF firmware (on
    distribution kernels ``sof_debug=1`` module option for ``snd_sof`` might be
    needed if the /sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace file is not present)

Trace filtering
***************

Current log levels can be changed for any instance of a component at
runtime. To do so, use the `-F` option and the following argument format:

   <log_level>="<component1>[, <component2>]"

Where *<log_level>* can be one of the following:

- ``c`` / ``critical``
- ``e`` / ``error``
- ``w`` / ``warning``
- ``i`` / ``info``
- ``d`` / ``debug``
- ``v`` / ``verbose``

After the **=** character, all components are listed in a comma-separated
format. Each component begins with *name* followed by an optional *instance*
description.

The list of possible component names comes from the UUID declaration.
Refer to the :ref:`uuid-api` for more detailed information. Use the ``-d``
flag in the logger to list component names from the ``ldc`` file content.

Example output:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $./sof-logger -d log/sof-cnl.ldc
      logger ABI Version is   5:2:0
      ldc_file ABI Version is 5:2:0

      Components uuid dictionary size:        824 bytes
      Components uuid base address:           0x1FFFA000
      Components uuid entries:
               ADDRESS                                    UUID NAME
            0x1FFFA000  <8b9d100c-6d78-418f-90a3-e0e805d0852b> host
            0x1FFFA01C  <f11818eb-e92e-4082-82a3-dc54c604ebb3> pipe-task
            0x1FFFA03C  <34dc0385-fc2f-4f7f-82d2-6cee444533e0> volume-task
            0x1FFFA05C  <b77e677e-5ff4-4188-af14-fba8bdbf8682> volume
            0x1FFFA078  <c1c5326d-8390-46b4-aa47-95c3beca6550> src
            0x1FFFA134  <c2b00d27-ffbc-4150-a51a-245c79c5e54b> dai
            -------------------------------------------------- cnt: 6

A special wildcard - ``*`` - can be used to apply a given trace level to
each component.

Instance descriptions can have one of the following forms:

- ``*`` - each component instance
- ``X.*`` - each component on selected pipeline *X*
- ``X.Y`` - component on pipeline *X* with id *Y*

Trace level changes works in the same order as options given in a command line, and a new set overwrites old values. It allows you to easily enable verbose logs only for selected components and keep the lowest possible log level (critical) for others, as shown in the following example:

   sof-logger -l ldc_file -t -Fcritical=* -Fverbose="dai*, volume1.1"

A similar example may be prepared for components on a particular pipeline:

   sof-loggerr -l ldc_file -t -Fc=* -Fv=*1.*

.. note::
  To track a verbose message, select the "Trace verbose" option under the "Trace" menu from the firmware build.

Active trace filters are stored in the firmware runtime memory, so after a firmware restart (such as after power gating in sleep mode) filters settings will be reset.

Consider disabling power gating during your debug session by entering the following:

.. code:: bash

  sudo su
  echo on >/sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:$(lspci -nn | grep "audio contoller" | awk '{print $1;}')/power/control

.. note::
  The current device power status can be read by entering this command:

  .. code:: bash

    cat /sys/devices/pci0000\:00/0000\:$(lspci -nn | grep "audio controller" | awk '{print $1;}')/power/runtime_status

The logger trace filtration affects only traces sent after the filter setup,
so traces already stored on the kernel side are not affected.

Filters are set up incrementally, so when loggers are run twice with
different settings, then filters from the first run will not be restored to
the default state but will be replaced by a new one. To reset filters to the
default state, a firmware reset is needed.

Detailed description
--------------------

The filtration mechanism occurs on the firmware side so, after changing the
log level to verbose for each component, the DSP can be overhelmed by
tracing.

Core functionality is provided by the DSP, so filtration does not work in
offline mode - during conversion in a previously saved input file.

Communication between the firmware and logger is occurs through driver
debug file systems. The logger writes new trace settings to ``sys/kernel/debug/sof/filter``. These will be used to create *IPC* messages with new
trace levels. A simple text data format is used:

``log1_level uuid1_id pipe1_id comp1_id; [log2_level uuid2_id pipe2_id comp2_id;]\n``

Any unused uuid_id should be set here to 0; other unused fields should be
set to -1. ``log_level`` must always be set to a valid value that represents ``LOG_LEVEL_*`` defined values.
