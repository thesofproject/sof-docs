Logger
######

The sof-logger is used to print logs delivered from the FW `dma_trace`
mechanism by searching log entries in the `ldc` file (logs dictionary)
that are generated by the *SMEX* (Sof Metadata Extractor) tool. Every entry
declared in the FW is placed in an elf output file (e.g. sof-apl) in the
`.static_log_entries` section in a struct form that is defined in `sof/src/include/sof/trace.h` in the `sof` fw repo.

The `ldc` file contains `snd_sof_logs_header` and `snd_sof_uids_header`
(defined in smex/ldc.h). `snd_sof_logs_header` is followed by a
`.static_log_entries` section incorporated from the FW elf file (e.g.
sof-apl). `snd_sof_logs_header` contains basic information about the
`.static_log_entries` section such as `base_address` and `data_length`. The
sof-logger works by reading entry parameters values and entries addresses from the FW `dma_trace` mechanism and searching for suitable entries in the
`ldc` file by its address. The `snd_sof_uids_header` struct is followed by
the `.static_uuid_entries` section content from the FW elf file. A single
uuid entry is defined in `sof/src/include/sof/lib/uuid.h` in the `sof` fw
repo.

Logger usage
************

Usage sof-logger <option(s)> <file(s)>

-h 		help
-l ldc_file	Specify the ldc file (debugging information and strings)
-i in_file	Get traces from the in_file instead of from the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-o out_file	Specify the output file instead of the default stdout
-t		Get traces from "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" instead of from the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-p		Get traces from stdin instead of the default "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace"
-c clock	Set the timestamp clock in MHz
-n		Disable checking the firmware version with the default verification file "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-v ver_file	Enable checking the firmware version with the ver_file file instead of the default: "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/fw_version"
-s		Take a snapshot of state
-r		Less formatted output for chained log processors
-L		Hide log location in source code
-f precision	Set timestamp precision
-g		Hide timestamp
-d		Dump ldc information

Examples:

- Gets traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file; disable compatibility
  check between given ldc_file with fw_version saved in default location
  and prints logs to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -n

- Gets traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file; verifies the
  fw_version with the ver_file file and prints logs to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -v ver_file

- Get traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to
  stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file

- Get traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/etrace" file and prints logs to
  the out_file file

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -o out_file

- Get traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to 
  stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -t

- Get traces from the "/sys/kernel/debug/sof/trace" file and prints logs to
  the out_file file

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -t -o out_file

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -p

- Get traces from stdin and prints logs to the out_file file

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -p -o out_file

- Get traces from the trace_dump file and prints logs to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump

- Get traces from the trace_dump file and prints logs to the out_file file

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file

- c flag defines the clock value (in MHz) used to format log timestamps. By
  default, the clock value is set to 19.2 (MHz). The below example sets the
  clock value to 19.9 (MHz).

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -i trace_dump -o out_file -c 19.9

- Dump information from the ldc file (such as the ABI version and the uuid
  dictionary) to stdout

  .. code-block:: bash

     sof-logger -l ldc_file -d
