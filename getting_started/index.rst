New to SOF or doing something for the first time ? Read on....

Building SOF
************

SOF can be built natively on a host PC or within a container. Use the container
method if the version of your distro is more than 6 months old. The SOF SDK
uses recent version of some external dependencies so the current distro release
is always preffered.
