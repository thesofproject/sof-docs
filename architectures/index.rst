Architecture
#######################

SOF is intended to run on many different hardware architectures and is therefore
not coupled to any particular DSP or host hardware architecture. The SOF
|TSC| ensures that any DSP or host architecture specific code is partitioned to
reside in architecture-specific directories with generic APIs to common code.

This section outlines the architecture at a high level; however, the source code
should always be consulted for the low level details.
