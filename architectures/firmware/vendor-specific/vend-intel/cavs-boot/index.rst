Booting up CAVS ADSP
####################

Intel has several generations of audio DSP. "CAVS" versions relate to the audio
DSP in Skylake Core and Apollo Lake Atom platforms onwards.

Bay Trail, Cherry Trail, Braswell, Haswell, and Broadwell audio DSPs have a simpler 
boot flow using memory copy and not authentication.
